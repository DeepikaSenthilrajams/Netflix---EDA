## ✅ What I Did

- **Loaded the Netflix dataset** using pandas.
- **Checked the dataset structure** using `.head()` and `.info()`.
- **Identified missing values** using `isnull().sum()` and explored how many nulls are present in each column.
- **Did not perform any imputation or feature engineering** — instead, analyzed null counts and considered which columns could be dropped.
- Explored which columns are useful and which ones could be **dropped** (like `show_id`, `description`, etc.).
